# Spark DataFrame and SQL Optimization Scenarios

## 1. Spark Shuffle Optimization Challenge

Scenario:
You are running a PySpark job that joins two large datasets (both are in Parquet format). The datasets are:
1. Customer Transactions (transactions_df) – 1 billion rows
2. Customer Profiles (customers_df) – 500 million rows

Each dataset is partitioned by country, but the Customer Profiles dataset is heavily skewed, meaning some countries have significantly more data than others.

Question: How would you optimize this join to handle the data skew and improve performance?

## 2. Data Skew and Join Optimization

Scenario:
You have two large DataFrames:
- transactions_df (1 billion rows): (transaction_id, customer_id, amount, date)
- customers_df (500 million rows): (customer_id, name, country)

You need to join these DataFrames on customer_id and then aggregate the total transaction amount per country.
However, the customers_df is heavily skewed by country (some countries have significantly more customers than others).

Question: How would you optimize this join and aggregation to handle the data skew and improve performance?

## 3. Window Functions and Partitioning

Scenario:
You have a DataFrame of retail sales data (100 million rows) with the following schema:
(store_id, product_id, sale_date, quantity, revenue)

You need to calculate the following for each store:
- Daily total revenue
- 7-day moving average of daily revenue
- Rank of products by revenue within each store

Question: How would you implement this using Spark SQL or DataFrame operations? How would you ensure the operation is performant?

## 4. Handling Late-Arriving Data

Scenario:
You have a DataFrame of event data (event_id, user_id, event_type, timestamp) with 1 billion rows.
The data is partitioned by date, but you frequently receive late-arriving data (events that arrived after their partition date).

You need to update your aggregations (daily active users, event counts per type) when late data arrives, without reprocessing all historical data.

Question: How would you design a Spark job to efficiently handle these late-arriving updates?

## 5. Complex Data Transformation

Scenario:
You have a DataFrame containing nested and array data types:
(user_id, name, purchases: array<struct<product_id: string, price: double, tags: array<string>>>)

You need to perform the following transformations:
- Explode the purchases array
- Calculate the total spent per user
- Find the most common tag across all purchases for each user

Question: How would you implement these transformations using Spark DataFrame operations or Spark SQL? What considerations would you keep in mind for performance?

## 6. Incremental Data Processing

Scenario:
You have a large DataFrame (500 million rows) of log data that is appended to daily. You need to process this data to extract certain metrics, but reprocessing the entire dataset each day is becoming too time-consuming.

Question: How would you implement an incremental processing solution using Spark? What Spark features or external tools might you use to make this efficient?

## 7. Optimizing Spark Aggregations

Scenario:
You have a DataFrame with 2 billion rows and 100 columns. You need to perform multiple aggregations (sum, average, count distinct) on different columns, grouped by 5 different categorical columns.

The job is currently taking several hours to complete.

Question: What strategies would you employ to optimize this aggregation job? How would you diagnose performance bottlenecks?
