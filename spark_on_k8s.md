spark-submit from inside a container (in a Kubernetes Job or Pod), pointing to a Kubernetes master (k8s://...).

That means:
	•	The Driver Pod is launched directly by your container running spark-submit.
	•	There’s no Spark Operator in the middle building the driver for you.
	•	The spark-submit process itself talks to the Kubernetes API to create driver/executor pods.

Here’s the ASCII diagram showing that direct submission path with clear boundaries:

+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|                      Your Code & Container                  |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| - Your Spark Application code (jar/py file)                 |
| - Custom Spark image with /opt/spark/bin/spark-submit        |
| - Kubernetes Job/Pod spec that runs spark-submit             |
|                                                             |
|   spark-submit \                                            |
|     --master k8s://https://<k8s-api-server> \                |
|     --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=<your image> ... |

                          v
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|         spark-submit Process (inside your container)         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| - Reads your app jar/py from local/S3                        |
| - Talks directly to Kubernetes API (using master URL)        |
| - Requests creation of the Driver Pod                        |

|   - Runs Spark Driver JVM                                    |
|   - Uses Spark configs + pod templates (driver.yaml/executor.yaml)
|   - Talks to K8s API to launch executors                     |
|       |                                                      |

|  [Executor Pod 1]   [Executor Pod 2]  ... [Executor Pod N]   |
|   - Spark JVM        Spark JVM              Spark JVM        |
|   - Executes tasks assigned by driver                        |
|                                                             |
|  All pods can read/write from S3/HDFS/JDBC etc.              |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+

Flow:
	1.	You deploy a Kubernetes Job/Pod with your Spark image.
	2.	That container runs spark-submit (no Spark Operator involved).
	3.	spark-submit talks to Kubernetes API → creates Driver Pod.
	4.	Driver Pod starts → creates Executor Pods based on your configs.
	5.	Job finishes → pods are deleted unless you keep them for logs/debugging.

If you want, I can draw a side-by-side comparison of Spark Operator mode vs Direct spark-submit mode so it’s visually obvious where that missing “Spark Operator box” would be in your current flow. That might make the architecture difference crystal clear.
